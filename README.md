**Quizlet flashcards to remnote!**

I designed this after wanting to cut out the annoying task of copy pasting quizlet flashcard words onto remnote, and was wasting time.
This is a simple .py script to do it, for you!


Tried to keep it easy, you input the link (ex: https://quizlet.com/318979098/ap-us-history-unit-1-flash-cards/)
Then, you choose the mode, depending which way you want your flashcards. Then, let it do the get request, parse it, and enjoy your newly done vocab words.
